## Validation 

### HTML Validation

I used [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate my html pages. I used the URL input from my deployed site on heroku to validate my code so any errors for my jinja templating were uncovered.

## Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse from my dev tools to analyse the efficiency of my site from desktop to mobile view. What I have seen from the results is that my mobile view's performance and accessibility is lower than my desktop view.
